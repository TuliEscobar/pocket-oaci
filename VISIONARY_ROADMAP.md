# OACI.ai: The Visionary Roadmap
> "To be the Pocket Bible for Global Aviation."

## 1. The Mission
**To empower every aviation professional—from the cockpit to the control tower—with instant, accurate, and AI-driven regulatory knowledge.**

We are not just building a search engine; we are building the **Universal Aviation Intelligence**. When a pilot asks, "What are the holding speed limits above FL140?", OACI.ai doesn't just give a link; it gives the *answer*, cited from ICAO Doc 8168, instantly.

## 2. The "Day 1" Philosophy (The Bezos Approach)
To build a product that impresses the giants, we must adhere to three core principles:

1.  **Customer Obsession**: Our customers are pilots, ATCs, dispatchers, and mechanics. They operate in high-stress, time-critical environments. Our product must be **fast**, **reliable**, and **offline-capable** (eventually).
2.  **Invent and Simplify**: Aviation documentation is dense and complex. OACI.ai simplifies this complexity into natural language conversations.
3.  **Think Big**: We start with ICAO documents (The Constitution of Aviation), but we aim for *all* aviation knowledge (National regulations, Company SOPs, Real-time data).

## 3. The Itinerary (Strategic Roadmap)

### Phase 1: The MVP - "Pocket OACI" (Current Focus)
**Goal**: Become the go-to reference for ICAO Standards.
*   **Core Content**: ICAO Annexes 1-19, Doc 4444 (PANS-ATM), Doc 8168 (PANS-OPS).
*   **Key Feature**: "Ask OACI" - A specialized AI chat interface that answers regulatory questions with precise citations.
*   **User Experience**: Premium, dark-mode, "cockpit-ready" aesthetic. Fast and distraction-free.

### Phase 2: The Expansion - "National Compliance"
**Goal**: Bridge the gap between international standards and local laws.
*   **Content Expansion**: Ingest FAA FARs, EASA AIR OPS, and other major national regulations.
*   **Feature**: "Diff Check" - Ask "How does EASA fuel policy differ from ICAO Annex 6?"

### Phase 3: The Ecosystem - "Operational Intelligence"
**Goal**: Integrate into the workflow.
*   **Integrations**: EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) plugins.
*   **Real-time**: "Analyze this NOTAM against my aircraft's limitations."

## 4. Legal & Brand Advisory
> [!WARNING]
> **Brand Name Risk**: "OACI" is the official acronym for the International Civil Aviation Organization. Using `OACI.ai` may invite scrutiny or UDRP (domain dispute) claims if the organization perceives it as "confusingly similar" or implying official endorsement.
> **Recommendation**: Proceed as requested for the MVP to validate the market, but be prepared to pivot the brand name (e.g., to "AeroMind", "SkyLaw", or "PocketOACI") if legal challenges arise. Ensure a clear disclaimer: *"Not affiliated with ICAO."*

## 5. Immediate Next Steps (The MVP)
1.  **Design the "Black Box" UI**: A stunning, high-contrast interface suitable for aviation professionals.
2.  **Build the Brain**: Create the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to index ICAO Annexes.
3.  **Launch**: Deploy the alpha version to a small group of pilots and ATCs for feedback.
