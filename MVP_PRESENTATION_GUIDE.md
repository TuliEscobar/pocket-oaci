# MVP Presentation Guide: OACI.ai 🎤

> **Goal**: Impress the audience (investors, partners, or "Jeff Bezos") with the vision of "Pocket OACI".

## 1. The Setup (Before you start)
*   **Device**: Use a tablet (iPad) or a laptop with a clean, dark wallpaper.
*   **Screen**: Ensure the app is in **Dark Mode** (default).
*   **Language**: Have the app set to **Spanish** initially (or the audience's native language).

## 2. The Pitch Script (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: The Hook (The Problem)
*   **Action**: Hold up a thick stack of papers (or show an image of ICAO Annexes).
*   **Say**: "This is the current state of aviation knowledge. Thousands of pages. Heavy. Hard to search. When a pilot needs an answer at 30,000 feet, they don't have time to flip through this."

### Step 2: The Reveal (The Solution)
*   **Action**: Open **OACI.ai** on your device. Show the clean, black "Black Box" interface.
*   **Say**: "This is OACI.ai. We call it 'Pocket OACI'. It's not a search engine; it's an aviation intelligence officer in your pocket."

### Step 3: The Live Demo (The "Magic")
*   **Action**: Type (or speak) a complex question.
    *   *Example (ES)*: "¿Cuáles son los mínimos meteorológicos para una aproximación CAT II?"
    *   *Example (EN)*: "What are the holding speeds above FL140?"
*   **Action**: Watch the AI generate the answer instantly.
*   **Point out**:
    1.  **The Answer**: Clear, natural language.
    2.  **The Citation**: "According to ICAO Annex 6..." (Tap the citation if clickable).
*   **Say**: "It doesn't just guess. It cites the law. It's the Bible, but it talks back."

### Step 4: The Bilingual Flex
*   **Action**: Toggle the language switch to **English**.
*   **Action**: Ask the same question or a new one.
*   **Say**: "Aviation is global. So are we. English, Spanish, and soon, every language in the sky."

### Step 5: The Vision (The "Bezos" Moment)
*   **Action**: Show the "Visionary Roadmap" slide or just speak to it.
*   **Say**: "Today, it's ICAO documents. Tomorrow, it's your airline's SOPs, your aircraft's manual, and real-time NOTAMs. We are building the operating system for aviation knowledge."

## 3. Key Talking Points (Q&A)
*   **"Is it legal?"**: "We are an assistive tool. The pilot is always command, but we give them the best information faster than any human could find it."
*   **"Why now?"**: "LLMs (Large Language Models) finally allow us to understand complex regulatory text. The tech caught up to the need."
*   **"Business Model"**: "Freemium for individuals (Pocket OACI), Enterprise licensing for Airlines (Custom Knowledge Bases)."

**Closing Line**: "OACI.ai. Fly smarter."
